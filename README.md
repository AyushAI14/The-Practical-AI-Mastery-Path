## 🚀 Learning Phases

### **1. Core Foundations**
> Build the base for all AI work.
- Python for AI/ML  
- Math for Machine Learning  
- Statistics & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- SQL

### **2. Machine Learning**
> Learn to train and evaluate traditional models.
- Scikit-learn end-to-end  
- Model lifecycle (ingestion → training → evaluation → deployment)  
- Key algorithms: Regression, Trees, SVM, Clustering, PCA  
- Model metrics & overfitting control  

### **3. Deep Learning**
> Move from hand-crafted features to neural networks.
- PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- Neural networks from scratch  
- Specializations:
  - Computer Vision (CV)
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)  ( My Choice )
  - Tabular / Structured Data  
- Applied AI Agents  

### **4. Generative AI & LLMs**
> Master modern AI systems.
- Foundation models (BERT, GPT, Llama, Mistral, Gemma)  
- LLM fine-tuning (LoRA, PEFT)  
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- LangChain / LlamaIndex  
- Prompt engineering + evaluation  

### **5. Agentic AI**
> Build intelligent, autonomous systems.
- Multi-agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, Autogen)  
- Memory, tool-use, planning  
- Workflow automation via API integration  
- Knowledge base systems (Milvus, ChromaDB)  

### **6. MLOps & Production Systems**
> Scale from prototype → production.
- CI/CD with Docker + GitHub Actions  
- Model versioning (DVC)  
- Deployment (AWS EC2/S3, FastAPI)  
- Monitoring & scaling pipelines

## 🏁 Final Outcome

> **Full-Stack AI Engineer**  
> Proficient across:
- Data Science & ML  
- Deep Learning  
- Generative & Agentic AI  
- MLOps & Deployment  

You’ll be able to design, train, and deploy intelligent AI systems — from data ingestion to automated agent execution.
